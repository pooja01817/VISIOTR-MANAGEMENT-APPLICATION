# VISIOTR-MANAGEMENT-APPLICATION                  
  This is a visitor management application. In this,we used react and node js to create this application and we use localhost.We used mongo database to store and retrive the data.
  This application is very useful for security purposes and managing the visitors. Here a host can manage residents and visitors where residents can manage their visitors. a visitor will get a qr pass with their details when a resident fill up their form and have to show the qr at security.
